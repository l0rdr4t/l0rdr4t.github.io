I am an arborist and my life is a tree, notched and crooked. Every day the tree grows in some areas and wanes in others. Each choice I make prunes away that from the tree which I no longer wish to tend. Surely, if the arborist worships a single leaf, the tree suffers. Enough time passes, and the tree will undoubted die.

The arborist may identify with the tree, but he is not the tree; the arborist is nothing without the tree.
