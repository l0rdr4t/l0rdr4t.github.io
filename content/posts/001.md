Notched and crooked, the tree changes constantly, growing in some areas and waning in others. The arborist prunes that from the tree which he no longer wishes to tend. Removal of dead foliage, shaped to fit an archetype, or showing off a specific flower or fruit to the outside world will tell you what the arborist values, and what he does not. The tree becomes more rigid and predictable with time, and materially identifiable as a marvel, a vulgarity or a mediocrity.

The arborist may identify with the tree, but he is not the tree; the arborist without the tree is without purpose.

Am I the arborist or am I the tree?
